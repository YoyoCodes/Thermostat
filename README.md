# The Thermostat App

## Setting up the foundations
This is a TDD javascript app that simulates a thermostat.

## Specification

Thermostat starts at 20 degrees<br>
You can increase the temperature with an up function<br>
You can decrease the temperature with a down function<br>
The minimum temperature is 10 degrees<br>
If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees<br>
If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees<br>
Power saving mode is on by default<br>
You can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function<br>
You can ask about the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is low-usage, < 25 is medium-usage, anything else is high-usage.<br>

## Implementing the requirements
I used a weather API to get the current temperature in a city selected by the user.
